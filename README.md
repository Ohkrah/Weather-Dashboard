# Weather Dashboard
Module 6 Challenge

## Description 
The task was to modify code to create an app that shows the weather for the next five days based on the location searched using server side API's. 

## Difficulties

### Scope adjustment
There was an issue with getting the scope to adjust for `fetchLocationData()` values so that they can be accessed inside of `getWeatherData`
